# Version 4

* No user-facing changes. Sets `content_security_policy` in extension
  manifest.

# Version 3

* Another version number upload collision, this time because Mozilla
  developer hub doesn't seem to support uploading an extension before
  making it visible.

# Version 2

* Nothing substantively changed, just resolving a version number
  collision in uploaded versions of the extension.

# Version 1

* Initial release! I'm mildly shocked that I actually spent the time
  to write this.
